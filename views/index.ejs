    <h1>Consistency is More Powerful Than Talent</h1>

    <p>We all know people who are very talented. They might be really good at sports, music, studies, or anything else. And sometimes, when we see them, we feel like we're not good enough because we don't have that natural talent. But the truth is, you don't need to be super talented to be successful. You just need to be consistent.</p>

    <h2>What is Consistency?</h2>
    <p>Consistency means doing something regularly. It means showing up every day, even when you don't feel like it. It means practicing again and again, even if you're not perfect.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Let's say there are two friends. One is very smart but studies only one day before the exam. The other one is an average student but studies for 30 minutes every day. In the end, the second person often scores better. Why? Because they were consistent. They didn't rely on last-minute talent - they built their knowledge slowly and steadily.</p>

    <h2>Real-Life Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Many famous people were not the best in the beginning. For example, Virat Kohli didn't become great overnight. He practiced every day, trained hard, and stayed focused. The same with actors, musicians, and even business people - they keep improving themselves every single day.</p>

    <h2>A Simple Analogy</h2>
    <p>Consistency is like brushing your teeth. If you do it every day, your teeth stay healthy. If you do it once a month, it's useless. Life works the same way.</p>

    <h2>Final Message</h2>
    <p>We often wait for motivation, or we say, "I'll start tomorrow." But successful people don't wait. They just do it - whether they feel motivated or not. That's the power of being consistent.</p>

    <blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 4px solid #28a745; padding-left: 16px; margin: 20px 0;">
      Don't be upset if you're not the best at something today. If you show up, if you try every day, even in small steps, you'll get better. And that's what matters the most.<br>
      <strong>Consistency beats talent - every single time.</strong>
